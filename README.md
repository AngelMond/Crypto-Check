# Team-Proyect-1

How we decided to develop this project:
* Each of the team members came with a project proposal, after some discussions and conversations about each of the poposal we decided by the most viable according to our current web development knowledge.

* Once an idea was selected, each of the teammembers created a draft of the project idea or desging before starting to code.

* Then we proceed to create High level user stories as a guide for code.

* The feature that we have developed is related with Cryptocurencies, these are the user stories we want to resolve as part of this project.

* Here is an example of the MVP proposal designs ![alt text](./assets/Images/Phase%201.png)

* As a user after selecting all the cryptocurrencies I want to be able get an estimate of the total investment from all the cryptocurrencies selected with the owned tokens.

* "Nice to have" - As a user I want the feature to create a graph with a pie chart that shows the total number of cryptocurrency tokens owned and show the % that each token represent in my total investment.

* As a user I want another feature that sends me an email notification of the Crypto token of my choice, the parameters to send the email will be determined by the Above price determined by the user and the under price determined by the user, so that I am able to know when to buy or sell the token of my interest.
